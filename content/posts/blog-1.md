![Why you should not wait to Naturalize](img/blog/blog-1/passport.jpg)

First, let’s go over the process of becoming a United States citizen through 
naturalization. 

Legal permanent residents (LPR) of the United States may apply for citizenship after 5 
years as permanent residents. In some circumstances, an LPR may apply for citizenship 
after 3 years (i.e. when residency was obtained through marriage). The application 
process consists of filling out form N-400 and submitting it to USCIS with supporting 
documentation, attending a background check, successfully completing the naturalization 
interview, and attending an oath ceremony where you will receive your certificate of 
citizenship. The entire process can take anywhere between 5 months to a year, depending 
on the complexity of the case. 

General requirements for naturalization: 

 Legal Permanent Resident for the past 5 years
 Have resided in the United States at least half of the time during the last 5 years
 No residence interruptions over 6 months
 Good Moral Character
 Able to take the English test and show sufficient knowledge of US history civics 

(There are some exceptions to the English requirement if the person is over 50 
and has been a resident for over 20 years, or if 55 and has been a resident for 
over 15 years.) 

The requirements seem very straight forward, and in fact, they are. However, many 
applicants are denied their citizenship because of the good moral character requirement. 
What this abstract requirement means is that the applicant must prove that he has not 
been convicted of any crimes of moral turpitude during the 5 year statutory period. 

Crimes of moral turpitude include offenses involving theft and fraud, harming other 
persons or another’s property, prostitution and solicitation, among many other offenses. 
Further, USCIS may deny applications due to failure to comply with child support 
guidelines, or pay taxes. Convictions of aggravated felonies such as murder and rape will 
indefinitely disqualify an applicant for naturalization. 

USCIS looks at the totality of the application when deciding, in its discretion, whether to 
approve an application. Offenses involving moral turpitude prior to the 5 years statutory 
period may cause an application for naturalization to be denied if the applicant fails to 
show that he or she has been rehabilitated. 

Now let’s get to the benefits of naturalization: 

Among the most popular rights of US citizens are the right to vote and the right to a US 
passport. However, there are many other more pressing reasons to apply for 
naturalization. 

1. Right to not be deported

This one is the main reason you should not delay applying. Many people are not aware 
that legal residents are deported daily from this country due to criminal violations. Most 
residents think it won’t happen to them. But both criminal and immigration laws 
constantly change, and before you know, you could be receiving a Notice to Appear in 
deportation proceedings. 

2. Right to petition your family

United States citizens may petition for spouses, parents, children, and siblings with 
minimal wait time. Permanent residents may only petition for spouses and children, and 
they often have to wait many months, or years, for a visa to become available. 

3. Right to Run for Public Office or Hold Federal Employment 

Permanent Residents do not have a right to run for public office; only U.S. citizens can. 
Further, federal jobs, which offer great benefits and high pay, are limited to US citizens. 

4. Right to Travel visa-free to most countries

United States citizens can travel to over 160 countries without having a visa to enter. The 
United States is among the top ranked countries for visa free travel. Think about how 
much money you will save on visas alone! 

So there you have it. I hope this post convinced you to stop waiting and apply to become 
a citizen of this great nation.
